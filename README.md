# 🏔️ Trentino — Interactive Animated Landing Page

An immersive, animation‑rich landing page inspired by the landscapes of Trentino.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**, this project showcases advanced UI animations, scroll‑triggered transitions, hover‑based card expansion, and dynamic background changes.

## 🧠 Overview

Trentino is one of my most advanced early front‑end projects.  
It blends smooth animations, dynamic UI transitions, and interactive elements to create a visually engaging experience.

The page features:
- A large animated logo that slides in/out based on scroll direction  
- A search bar with custom open/close animations  
- Three interactive cards (Montagne, Laghi, Paesini) that expand on hover  
- A background that changes dynamically depending on the selected card  
- Smooth fade‑ins, slide‑ins, and blur effects  

Everything is built without frameworks — only **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery**.
